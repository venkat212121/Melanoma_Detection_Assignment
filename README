## General Information
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. 
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.
It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate 
images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the 
potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, 
which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). 
All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, 
and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, 
whose images are slightly dominant.


The data set contains the following diseases:

Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented benign keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis
Squamous cell carcinoma
Vascular lesion


## Conclusions

Even though, it's too early to comment on the overfitting & underfitting.
The model seems to be overfitting because we can see difference in loss functions in training & test around the 10-11th epoch.
The accuracy is around 70-80% because there are enough features to remember the pattern.

We can try to increase the epochs to increase the accuracy.Even though there is no improvement in accuracy, 
we can see the overfitting problem was resolve due to the data augmentation
